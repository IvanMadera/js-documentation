# Declaring variables

You can declare a variable in three ways:
With the keyword var. For example,

```js
var x = 42.
```

This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.

By simply assigning it a value. For example,

```js
x = 42.
```

This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.

With the keyword let. For example,

```js
let y = 13.
```

This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
